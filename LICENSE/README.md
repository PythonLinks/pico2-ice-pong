# LICENSE
This software is subject to two licenses.

Most of the software is subject to the MIT License.

In the Verilator directory there are three files `makefile`,
`tb_top.cpp`, and `top.sv` which were copied from
https://git.shylie.info/shylie/pico-ice-video.  They were originally
part of the SDL graphics library, and so they are subject to the zlib
license.

Both licenses are included in this directory.
